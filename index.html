                            Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and
                            elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use
                            variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and
                            more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass
                            helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get
                            small stylesheets up and running quickly,
                            particularly with the help of the Compass style
                            library.

                        <p>
                            There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The
                            first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout
                            this reference, is an extension of the syntax of
                            CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a
                            valid SCSS file with the same meaning. In addition,
                            SCSS understands most CSS hacks and vendor-specific
                            syntax, such as IE's old filter syntax. This syntax
                            is enhanced with the Sass features described below.
                            Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The second and older syntax, known as the indented
                            syntax (or sometimes just "Sass"), provides a more
                            concise way of writing CSS. It uses indentation
                            rather than brackets to indicate nesting of
                            selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to
                            separate properties. Some people find this to be
                            easier to read and quicker to write than SCSS. The
                            indented syntax has all the same features, although
                            some of them have slightly different syntax; this is
                            described in the indented syntax reference. Files
                            using this syntax have the .sass extension.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Either syntax can import files written in the other.
                            Files can be automatically converted from one syntax
                            to the other using the sass-convert command line
                            tool:
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <code>
                            # Convert Sass to SCSS $ sass-convert style.sass
                            style.scss
                            <br />
                            # Convert SCSS to Sass $ sass-convert style.scss
                            style.sass
                        </code>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>
                            Note that this command does not generate CSS files.
                            For that, use the sass command described elsewhere.

                            The most straightforward way to use SassScript is to
                            use variables. Variables begin with dollar signs,
                            and are set like CSS properties:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>$width: 5em;</code></pre>
                        <p>You can then refer to them in properties:</p>
                        <pre><code>#main {
                                    width: $width;

                        <p>
                            Mixins allow you to define styles that can be
                            re-used throughout the stylesheet without needing to
                            resort to non-semantic classes like .float-left.
                            Mixins can also contain full CSS rules, and anything
                            else allowed elsewhere in a Sass document. They can
                            even take arguments which allows you to produce a
                            wide variety of styles with very few mixins.

                        <p>Defining a Mixin: @mixin</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Mixins are defined with the @mixin directive. It's
                            followed by the name of the mixin and optionally the
                            arguments, and a block containing the contents of
                            the mixin. For example, the large-text mixin is
                            defined as follows:
                        </p>
                        <br />

                                            }

                        <p>
                            Mixins are included in the document with the
                            @include directive. This takes the name of a mixin
                            and optionally arguments to pass to it, and includes
                            the styles defined by that mixin into the current
                            rule. For example:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>

                            and use them in any value or script context. For
